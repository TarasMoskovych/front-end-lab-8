                      but is still extremely well-established. Java is over 20 years old, used by millions 
                      of developers and billions of devices worldwide, and able to run on any hardware and 
                      operating system through the Java Virtual Machine. All Android apps are based on Java 
                      and 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies use Java as a server-side language for backend 
                      development. Java Enterprise Edition 8 and Java 9 both launched in September 2017 as 
                      the Eclipse Foundation took over managing Java EE from Oracle.`,

        description: `Python grew in popularity by about 5,000 job postings over 2017. It is a general-purpose 
                      programming language used for web development and as a support language for software 
                      developers. It’s also widely used in scientific computing, data mining and machine learning. 
                      The continued growth and demand for machine learning developers may be driving the popularity 
                      of Python.`,

        description: `JavaScript, the grandfather of programming languages, is roughly as popular today as it was
                      in our last blog post. That’s no surprise to us – JavaScript is used by over 80% of developers 
                      and by 95% of all websites for any dynamic logic on their pages. Several front-end frameworks 
                      for JavaScript such as React and AngularJS have huge future potential as IoT and mobile devices 
                      become more popular, so we doubt we’ll see JavaScript drop in popularity anytime soon.`,

                      “C” programming language, C++ is usually used for system/application software, game development, 
                      drivers, client-server applications and embedded firmware. Many programmers find C++ complex 
                      and more difficult to learn and use than languages like Python or JavaScript, but it remains 
                      in use in many legacy systems at large enterprises`,
